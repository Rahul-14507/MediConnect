You are building a simple hackathon prototype called "VillageCare" â€” a telemedicine platform for rural communities where people can call or SMS a number to connect with a doctor. The demo must work with my own phone number (no new SIM, no paid APIs like Twilio). The app should be built using FlutterFlow + Firebase as backend, but give me backend code in Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI/Flask) that I can run locally in Replit for simulation.

Core requirements:

1. **Patient App (FlutterFlow)**
   - A home screen with two buttons:
     a. "ðŸ“ž Call Doctor" â†’ opens phone dialer with MY OWN number pre-filled.
     b. "ðŸ’¬ Send SMS" â†’ opens SMS app with MY OWN number pre-filled and message template like "Fever, need help".
   - A "Chat Simulation" screen that pulls messages from Firebase to show doctor replies, like a chat UI (simulate SMS replies).

2. **Doctor Dashboard (Web via Firebase + Replit backend)**
   - A login page (basic username/password stored in Firebase).
   - A dashboard page that shows:
     - Patient name
     - Symptom/message
     - Time received
   - A button "Simulate Inbound Call" â†’ inserts a fake patient request into Firebase (for demo).
   - A text box for doctor to send back a "Reply" â†’ pushes the reply into Firebase so it appears on patientâ€™s chat screen.

3. **Backend Simulation (Replit)**
   - Code that connects to Firebase Firestore.
   - REST endpoints:
     - POST /simulate-call â†’ adds dummy patient request
     - POST /reply â†’ doctor sends advice, stores in Firebase
     - GET /messages â†’ fetch all patient-doctor conversations
   - Use JSON format for messages with fields:
     {
       "patientName": string,
       "symptom": string,
       "timestamp": number,
       "doctorReply": string
     }

4. **Demo Flow (for judges)**
   - Patient clicks "Call Doctor" â†’ shows phone dialer with my number.
   - Patient clicks "Send SMS" â†’ shows SMS app with my number.
   - In the demo, I (doctor) go to dashboard, click "Simulate Inbound Call".
   - Doctor writes a reply, which appears instantly on patient appâ€™s chat UI.
   - Judges understand how this would work with real calls/SMS if integrated with telecom APIs.

Important:
- Keep everything **simple, minimal, hackathon-ready**.
